# STM32UAVGazebo
UAV simulation project using STM32, FlySky FS-i6, and FS-iA6B in Gazebo. PX4 provides simulated sensor data (IMU, GPS, barometer) while STM32 handles motor control and receiver signals. Supports hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing for validating flight control before real-world deployment.
